 Date:     April 3, 2024
 
 This introductory programming activity for the mirobo.tech ARPS circuit
 demonstrates pushbutton input, LED outut, the use of time delay functions,
 and simple 'if' condition structures.
 
 Additional programming analysis activities explore I/O pin behaviour,
 compare the operation of 'if' and 'while' structures, and demonstrate 
 logical AND and OR conditions. Programming activities intruduce the tone()
 function to create sounds, and encourage learners to create software-based
 simulated start-stop buttons and a bicycle turn signal program.

/* Learn More -- Program Analysis Activities
 *
 * 1. Let's analyze this program! Program analysis is an important skill to 
 *    develop to better understand a program's operation. Start by running the
 *    program in your circuit board. Press and immediately release SW2 and watch
 *    what the LEDs do. How many LEDs flash? How many times to they flash? Next,
 *    press and hold SW2 and observe the LEDs and flashing pattern. Does the
 *    pattern stop immediately when you let go of SW2?
 * 
 *    Now, examine the program and try to match your observations of the light
 *    pattern to the program code. How many digitalWrite() and delay statements
 *    are grouped together inside the curly braces that follow the SW2State 'if'
 *    statement? Did all of these actions happen when you pressed and let go of
 *    SW2? Can you explain why the microcontroller will always complete all of
 *    the actions inside the braces, and not skip any of the steps each time
 *    pushbutton SW2 is pressed?
 * 
 * 2. Explain the difference between the statements: 'digitalWrite(LED2,HIGH);'
 *    and 'digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);'. How does setting the LED2 pin high or low
 *    actually turn LED2 on or off on the circuit board?
 * 
 * 3. Understanding how a circuit works is another important skill to develop
 *    in interfacing (controlling hardware with software). What voltage do you
 *    expect the microcontroller to output to LED D2 when the statement
 *    'digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);' runs? What voltage do you expect the output to
 *    be when the statement 'digitalWrite(LED2,HIGH);' runs?
 * 
 *    If you have access to a voltmeter, you can use it confirm the output
 *    voltage of the microcontroller in the circuit. Try measuring across one
 *    of the LEDs as the program outputs a LOW, and again when it outputs a 
 *    HIGH. The voltage will change quickly so you may need to use a 'peak hold'
 *    or 'max' feature if your multimeter has one, or slow down the light pattern
 *    by increasing the value of one or more of the time delay() functions.
 * 
 *    Next, carefully measure the voltage between one of the LED header pins and
 *    one of the GND (ground, or common) header pins as you run the program and
 *    press SW2. (Refer to the pin definitions at the top of the program to find
 *    which digital pins connect to the LEDs.) Compare your measurements. Did one
 *    of these voltages match your prediction? Which one? Can you explain why?
 * 
 * 4. The statement 'SW2State = digitalRead(SW2);' contains a single equal sign
 *    while the statement 'if(SW2State == LOW)' contains two equal signs. What
 *    operation is performed by a statement using one equal sign? What operation
 *    is performed by a statement using two equal signs? How are the two
 *    operations different?
 * 
 * 5. Find the switch circuits on the schematic diagram. Why do you think the
 *    program code uses the statement 'if(SW2State == LOW)' to sense if a switch
 *    is pressed? Can you use the schematic and this program's setup() function
 *    code to explain why the input voltage on one of the microcontroller's
 *    switch inputs will be low when the switch is pressed?
 *  
 * 6. Let's compare the operation of 'if' and 'while' structures to simulate the
 *    operation of real-world momentary buttons. Add the following code below
 *    the existing 'if(SW2State == LOW)' block in the program, and then compile
 *    and re-upload your program to your Arduino.

  // Momentary button using an if structure
  SW4State = digitalRead(SW4);
  if(SW4State == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED4,HIGH);
  }
  else {
      digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);
  }

  // Momentary button using a while structure
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);
  while(SW5State == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED5,HIGH);
      SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);
  }
  digitalWrite(LED5,LOW);

 *    First, try pressing and releasing SW4 and SW5 one at a time. They should
 *    act the same way, turning their respective LEDs on as each switch is
 *    pressed, and off as each switch is released.
 * 
 *    Next, press and hold SW4 while pressing and releasing SW5. Does SW5 work
 *    as expected? (In the Tinkercad simulator, Shift-clicking a button will
 *    hold it so that another button can be pressed.)
 * 
 *    Last, press and hold SW5 while pressing and releasing SW4. Does SW4 work
 *    as expected?
 * 
 *    Can you explain the difference in operation between the 'if' and 'while'
 *    structures in the two different examples of momentary button code?
 *
 * 7. Comment-out the second 'SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);' statement inside 
 *    the while loop by adding two slashes '//' at the beginning of the line,
 *    like this: '//SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);'. Re-upload your program and
 *    test SW5 again. After that, try testing SW4 and SW5. Do they still work?
 *    If the program seems to be getting stuck, press and release the SW1
 *    RESET pushbutton to re-start it. Explain what you think is happening and
 *    why the microcontroller might be operating that way. 
 * 
 * 8. Let's explore logical conditions made using 'if' statements. Replace the
 *    program code added in steps 6 and 7, above, with this 'nested if' code.
 *    These program instructions will create a logical AND condition that
 *    lights LED D4 only if both SW4 and SW5 are pressed:

  SW4State = digitalRead(SW4);
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);

  if(SW4State == LOW) {
    if(SW5State == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED4,HIGH);
    }
    else {
      digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);
    }
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);
  }

 *    Test the code to ensure it works as expected. Does the order of the if
 *    conditions matter? (e.g. swap the conditional checks for SW4 and SW5)
 * 
 * 9. Next, replace the code from activity 8, above, with the following code
 *    which implements the logical AND conditional operator â€“ it's composed of
 *    two ampersands '&&' and becomes part of the 'if' statement:
 
  SW4State = digitalRead(SW4);
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);
  
  if(SW4State == LOW && SW5State == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(LED4,HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);
  }

 *    Does '&&' work the same way as the nested if structures? Can you think of
 *    at least one advantage of using a logical conditional operator instead of
 *    nested if structures?
 * 
 * 10. Replace the double ampersand '&&' with double vertical bars '||' to make
 *    a logical OR conditional operator. Your code should now look like this:
  
  SW4State = digitalRead(SW4);
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);
  
  if(SW4State == LOW || SW5State == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(LED4,HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);
  }

 *    Describe the conditions under which LED4 turns on.
 * 
 * Programming Activities
 * 
 * 1. The statement 'delay(100);' creates a 100ms delay. Try changing one or
 *    more of the delay values in the program to 500ms and see what happens.
 * 
 *    Look up the delay() function in the Arduino reference documentation.
 *    What is one problem you might run into when using the delay() function
 *    for long delays in your program?
 * 
 * 2. The 'delay()' function accepts only integers as delay values. To create
 *    delays shorter than 1 ms, a different function must be used instead. Use
 *    the 'delayMicroseconds()' function to specify shorter time delays using
 *    microseconds instead of milliseconds.
 * 
 *    You won't be able to see microsecond length LED flashes with your eyes,
 *    but you can measure them using an oscilloscope or hear them if they are
 *    used to turn the piezo beeper on and off. Try the following code in your
 *    program. The delay was chosen to be the time period of music note A5
 *    which should play a tone at a frequency of 880Hz.
 
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);    // Make a tone while SW5 is held
  if(SW5State == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(BEEPER,HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(567);
    digitalWrite(BEEPER,LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(567);
  }

 *    It definitely makes a sound when SW5 is pressed, but it doesn't sound
 *    like the note that it is supposed to play. Can you guess why?
 * 
 *    The 'delay(10);' statement at the end of the program is the problem â€“ it
 *    makes the delay muuuuuch longer than 567Âµs. The 10ms delay is not needed
 *    when running the program in an actual Arduino circuit, but it has been
 *    added to this program because it helps some Arduino simulators work better
 *    by limiting the number of times the main loop runs every second. Comment
 *    out the 'delay(10);' statement for the remainder of the programming
 *    activities in this activity and try the program in your circuit again.
 *
 *    Does it sound more like a tone now? Next, try changing the delay values.
 *    Does the pitch of the tone increase or decrease if the delay values are
 *    made smaller? Does the opposite happen if the delays are made larger?
 * 
 * 3. Arduino has a built-in tone() function that can be used to make a
 *    specified sound frequency without the programmer needing to calculate a
 *    delay time period. Replace the code, above, with this code:
 
  SW5State = digitalRead(SW5);    // Make a tone when SW5 is pressed
  if(SW5State == LOW) {
    tone(BEEPER,880);
  }

 *    The tone can be silenced by pressing the RESET (SW1) button on ARPS, or
 *    in your program by using a 'noTone(BEEPER);' statement. Modify your
 *    program using either a second 'if' condition or an 'else' condition so
 *    that it plays a tone while SW5 is held and stops when SW5 is released.
 *
 * 4. The setup() function includes a tone() function to make a sound on
 *    start-up. How is the tone() function in setup() different than the one
 *    in the example above? What does the third parameter control? (Hint:
 *    you can find out more about tone() in the Adruino reference documents.)
 * 
 * 5. Using modified versions of the original SW2 'if' structure, create a
 *    program that makes a unique LED flashing pattern for each pushbutton.
 * 
 *    Test each of your flashing patterns to verify that they work as expected.
 *    Describe what happens when more than one button is held. Do all of the
 *    patterns flash the LEDs at the same time, or in sequence? What sequence
 *    do they follow? Explain why this happens.
 * 
 * 6. Use individual 'if' structures to simulate 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons for
 *    an industrial machine. Use SW4 as the Start button to turn LED D4 on when
 *    it is pressed, and make sure LED D4 stays on even after SW4 has been
 *    released. Use SW5 as the Stop button to turn LED D4 off when it is pressed.
 *    Test your program to make sure that it works the way you expect it to.
 * 
 * 7. Running your program from step 6, above, describe what happens when both
 *    pushbuttons SW4 and SW5 are held. Does LED D4 turn on? Does LED D4 stay
 *    on? If so, is its brightness the same when both buttons are held as when
 *    just SW4 is pressed? If the brightness is different, can you explain what
 *    part of the code might be causing it to change, and why it changes?
 *    Hint: pretend to be the computer and simulate what the program is doing.
 * 
 * 8. As you might imagine, an industrial machine that is able to turn on an
 *    output even while its 'Stop' button is pressed represents a significant
 *    safety hazard. Using one or more of the logical conditional operators
 *    introduced in the analysis activities, above, modify your start-stop
 *    program to make it operate safely. SW4 should only be able to turn on
 *    LED D4 if switch SW5 is not being pressed at the same time.
 *
 * 9. Create a program that uses the ARPS pushbuttons and LEDs to make a turn
 *    signal circuit for a bicycle. Use SW2 and SW5 to indicate left or right
 *    turns, and think about the best way to implement turn signals using a set
 *    of LEDS controlled by a pair of similar momentary pushbuttons mounted on
 *    a bicycle's handlebars. Would the user have to hold a button to keep the
 *    turn signal flashing, or would pressing the button once start the turn
 *    signal and keep it going until the button was pressed again to cancel it?
 *    What will the turn signal indication look like if the four LEDs were
 *    mounted horizontally under the seat of the bicycle? Write a program that
 *    implements your best turn signal solution using the concepts learned in
 *    this activity. Test your solution to ensure it behaves as expected under
 *    unusual use cases such as the user holding both buttons, for example.
 *
 *10. Modify your bike turn signal program, above, to use one or both of the
 *    other buttons to add brake functionality, and/or to implement a rapidly
 *    flashing tail-light for enhanced visibility. Test your program to ensure
 *    that all of its functions work as expected under all conditions.
