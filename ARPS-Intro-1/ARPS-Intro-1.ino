/* Learn More -- Program Analysis Activities
 *
 * 1. Let's analyze this program! Program analysis is an important skill to 
 *    develop to better understand a program's operation. Start by running the
 *    program in your circuit board. Press and immediately release SW2 and watch
 *    what the LEDs do. How many LEDs flash? How many times to they flash? Next,
 *    press and hold SW2 and observe the LEDs and flashing pattern. Does the
 *    pattern stop immediately when you let go of SW2?
 * 
 *    Now, examine the program and try to match your observations of the light
 *    pattern to the program code. How many digitalWrite and delay statements
 *    are grouped together inside the curly braces that follow the SW2state 'if'
 *    statement? Did all of these actions happen when you pressed and let go of
 *    SW2? Can you explain why the microcontroller will always complete all of
 *    the actions inside the braces, and not skip any of the steps each time
 *    pushbutton SW2 is pressed?
 * 
 * 2. Explain the difference between the statements: 'digitalWrite(LED2,HIGH);'
 *    and 'digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);'. How does setting the LED2 pin high or low
 *    actually turn LED2 on or off on the circuit board?
 * 
 * 3. Understanding how a circuit works is another important skill to develop
 *    in interfacing (controlling hardware with software). What voltage do you
 *    expect the microcontroller to output to LED D2 when the statement
 *    'digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);' runs? What voltage do you expect the output to
 *    be when the statement 'digitalWrite(LED2,HIGH);' runs?
 * 
 *    If you have access to a voltmeter, you can use it confirm the output
 *    voltage of the microcontroller in the circuit. Try measuring across one
 *    of the LEDs as the program outputs a LOW, and again when it outputs a 
 *    HIGH. The voltage will change quickly so you may need to use a 'peak hold'
 *    or 'max' feature if your multimeter has one, or slow down the light pattern
 *    in your program by increasing the value of one or more of the time delays.
 * 
 *    Next, carefully measure the voltage between one of the LED header pins and
 *    one of the GND (ground, or common) header pins as you run the program and
 *    press SW2. (Refer to the pin definitions at the top of the program to find
 *    which digital pins connect to the LEDs.) Compare your measurements. Did one
 *    of these voltages match your prediction? Which one? Can you explain why?
 * 
 * 4. The statement 'SW2state = digitalRead(SW2);' contains a single equal sign
 *    while the statement 'if(SW2state == LOW)' contains two equal signs. What
 *    operation is performed by a statement using one equal sign? What operation
 *    is performed by a statement using two equal signs? How are the two
 *    operations different?
 * 
 * 5. Find the switch circuits on the schematic diagram. Why do you think the
 *    program code uses the statement 'if(SW2state == LOW)' to sense if a switch
 *    is pressed? Can you use the schematic and this program's setup() function
 *    code to explain why the input voltage on one of the microcontroller's
 *    switch inputs will be low when the switch is pressed?
 *  
 * 6. Let's compare the operation of 'if' and 'while' structures to simulate the
 *    operation of real-world momentary buttons. Add the following code below
 *    the existing 'if(SW2state == LOW)' block in the program, and then compile
 *    and re-upload your program to your Arduino.

  // Momentary button using an if structure
  SW3state = digitalRead(SW3);
  if(SW3state == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED3,HIGH);
  }
  else {
      digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);
  }

  // Momentary button using a while structure
  SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);
  while(SW4state == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED4,HIGH);
      SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);
  }
  digitalWrite(LED4,LOW);

 *    First, try pressing and releasing SW3 and SW4 one at a time. They should
 *    act the same way, turning their respective LEDs on as each switch is
 *    pressed, and off as each switch is released.
 * 
 *    Next, press and hold SW3 while pressing and releasing SW4. Does SW4 work
 *    as expected?
 * 
 *    Last, press and hold SW4 while pressing and releasing SW3. Does SW3 work
 *    as expected?
 * 
 *    Can you explain the difference in operation between the 'if' and 'while'
 *    structures in the two different examples of momentary button code?
 *
 * 7. Comment-out the second 'SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);' (the one inside 
 *    the while loop) by adding two slashes '//' at the start of the line,
 *    like this: '//SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);'. Re-upload your program and
 *    test SW4 again. After that, try testing SW2 and SW3. Do they still work?
 *    If the program seems to be getting stuck, press and release the SW1
 *    RESET pushbutton to re-start it. Explain what you think is happening and
 *    why the microcontroller might be doing that. 
 * 
 * 8. Let's explore logical conditions made using 'if' statements. Replace the
 *    program code added in steps 6 and 7, above, with this 'nested if' code
 *    to create a logical AND condition that will light LED D3 only if both
 *    SW3 and SW4 are pressed:

  SW3state = digitalRead(SW3);
  SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);

  if(SW3state == LOW) {
    if(SW4state == LOW) {
      digitalWrite(LED3,HIGH);
    }
    else {
      digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);
    }
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);
  }

 *    Test the code to ensure it works as expected. Does the order of the if
 *    conditions matter? (e.g. swap the conditional checks for SW3 and SW4)
 * 
 * 9. Next, replace the code from activity 8, above, with the following code
 *    which implements the logical AND conditional operator â€“ it's composed of
 *    two ampersands '&&' and becomes part of the 'if' statement:
 
  SW3state = digitalRead(SW3);
  SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);
  
  if(SW3state == LOW && SW4state == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(LED3,HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);
  }

 *    Does '&&' work the same way as the nested if structures? Can you think of
 *    at least one advantage of using a logical conditional operator instead of
 *    nested if structures?
 * 
 * 10. Replace the double ampersand '&&' with double vertical bars '||' to make
 *    a logical OR conditional operator. Your code should now look like this:
  
  SW3state = digitalRead(SW3);
  SW4state = digitalRead(SW4);
  
  if(SW3state == LOW || SW4state == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(LED3,HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(LED3,LOW);
  }

 *    Describe the conditions under which LED3 turns on.
 * 
 * Programming Activities
 * 
 * 1. The statement 'delay(100);' creates a 100ms delay. Try changing one or
 *    more of the delay values in the program to 500ms and see what happens.
 * 
 *    Look up the delay() function in the Arduino reference documentation.
 *    What is one problem you might run into when using the delay() function
 *    for long delays in your program?
 * 
 * 2. The 'delay()' function accepts only integers as delay values. To create
 *    delays shorter than 1 ms, a different function must be used instead. Use
 *    the 'delayMicroseconds()' function to specify time delays in
 *    microseconds instead of milliseconds.
 * 
 *    You won't be able to see microsecond length LED flashes with your eyes,
 *    but you can measure them using an oscilloscope or hear them if they are
 *    used to turn the piezo beeper on and off. Try the following code in your
 *    program. The delay was chosen to be the time period of music note A5
 *    which should play a tone at a frequency of 880Hz.
 
  SW5state = digitalRead(SW5);    // Make a tone while SW5 is held
  if(SW5state == LOW) {
    digitalWrite(BEEPER,HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(567);
    digitalWrite(BEEPER,LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(567);
  }

 *    It definitely makes a sound when SW5 is pressed, but it doesn't sound
 *    like the note that it is supposed to play. Can you guess why?
 * 
 *    The 'delay(10);' statement at the end of the program is the problem â€“ it
 *    makes the delay muuuuuch longer than 567Âµs. The 10ms delay is not needed
 *    when running the program in an actual Arduino circuit, but it has been
 *    added to this program because it helps some Arduino simulators work better
 *    by limiting the number of times the main loop runs every second. Comment
 *    out the 'delay(10);' statement for the remainder of the programming
 *    activities in this program and try the program in your circuit again.
 *
 *    Did it sound more like a tone now? Next, try changing the delay values.
 *    Does the pitch of the tone increase or decrease if the delay values are
 *    made smaller? Does the opposite happen if the delays are made larger?
 * 
 * 3. Arduino has a built-in tone() function that can be used to make a
 *    specified sound frequency without the programmer needing to calculate a
 *    delay time period. Replace the code, above, with this code:
 
  SW5state = digitalRead(SW5);    // Make a tone when SW5 is pressed
  if(SW5state == LOW) {
    tone(BEEPER,880);
  }

 *    The tone can be silenced by pressing the RESET (SW1) button on ARPS, or
 *    in your program by using a 'noTone(BEEPER);' statement. Modify your
 *    program using either a second 'if' condition or an 'else' condition so
 *    that the it only plays while SW5 is held and stops when SW5 is released.
 *
 * 4. The setup() function includes a tone() function to make a sound on
 *    start-up. How is the tone() function in setup() different than the one
 *    in the example above? What does the third parameter control? (Hint:
 *    you can find out more about tone() in the Adruino reference documents.)
 * 
 * 5. Using modified versions of the original SW2 'if' structure, create a
 *    program that makes a unique LED flashing pattern for each pushbutton.
 * 
 *    Test each of your flashing patterns to verify that they work as expected.
 *    Describe what happens when more than one button is held. Do all of the
 *    patterns flash the LEDs at the same time, or in sequence? What sequence
 *    do they follow? Explain why this happens.
 * 
 * 6. Use individual 'if' structures to simulate 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons for
 *    an industrial machine. Use SW3 as the Start button to turn LED D3 on when
 *    it is pressed, and keep LED D3 on even after SW3 has been released. Use
 *    SW4 as the Stop button to turn LED D3 off when it is pressed. Test your
 *    program to make sure that it works the way you expect it to.
 * 
 * 7. Running your program from step 6, above, describe what happens when both
 *    pushbuttons SW3 and SW4 are held. Does LED D3 turn on? Does LED D3 stay
 *    on? If so, is its brightness the same when both buttons are held as when
 *    just SW3 is pressed? If the brightness is different, can you explain what
 *    part of the code might be causing it to change, and why it changes?
 *    Hint: pretend to be the computer and simulate what the program is doing.
 * 
 * 8. As you might imagine, an industrial machine that is able to turn on an
 *    output even while its 'Stop' button is pressed represents a significant
 *    safety hazard. Using one or more of the logical conditional operators
 *    introduced in the analysis activities, above, modify your start-stop
 *    program to make it safer. SW3 should only be able to turn LED D3 on if
 *    switch SW4 is not being pressed at the same time.
 *
 * 9. Create a program that uses the ARPS pushbuttons and LEDs to make a turn
 *    signal circuit for a bicycle. Use SW2 and SW5 to indicate left or right
 *    turns, and think about the best way to implement turn signals if a pair
 *    of similar momentary pushbuttons were mounted on a bicycle's handlebars.
 *    Would the user have to hold the button to keep the turn signal flashing,
 *    or would pressing the button once start the turn signal and keep it going
 *    until the button was pressed again to cancel it? What will the turn signal
 *    indication look like if the four LEDs were to be mounted horizontally
 *    under the seat of the bicycle? Write a program that implements your best
 *    turn signal solution using the concepts learned in this activity. Test
 *    your solution to ensure it behaves as expected under unusual use cases
 *    such as the user holding both buttons, for example.
 *
 *10. Modify your bike turn signal program, above, to use one or both of the
 *    other buttons to add brake functionality, and/or to implement a rapidly
 *    flashing tail-light for enhanced visibility. Test your program to ensure
 *    that all of its functions work as expected under all conditions.
